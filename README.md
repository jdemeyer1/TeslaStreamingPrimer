# Tesla Streaming Primer
This repository contains a small Java program that demonstrates the basics of streaming data from a Tesla electric vehicle.

## Getting Started
The Java program requires an authenitcation token and vehicle identifier.  Use the APIs described [here](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/) or [here](https://www.teslaapi.io/) to get the token and identifier.  I recommend [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to work with the APIs.

The Java program imports the nv-websocket-client library located [here](https://github.com/TakahikoKawasaki/nv-websocket-client).
