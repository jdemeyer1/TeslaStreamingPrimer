# Tesla Streaming Primer
This repository contains a small Java program that demonstrates the basics of streaming data from a Tesla electric vehicle.

## Getting Started
The Java program requires an authenitcation token and vehicle identifier.  Use the APIs described [here](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/) or [here](https://www.teslaapi.io/) to get the token and identifier.  I recommend Postman to work with the APIs.
